# Arcade Machine Spring 2018

These games were created as part of CS Club's Spring 2018 project to build an arcade machine from scratch to raise money for Relay for Life. The Circle Shooter games (both one- and two-player) were my component of the project; the rest was created by other members of CS Club, namely Ben Moskow, Tom Pruter, Casey Benson, and Leo Carrico. Special thanks to Leo Carrico for writing the game engine that these games use.

## Running the games

If you'd like to run the games to test them out, multigame/MultiGameRunner is the class that runs the arcade machine home screen and gives you access to play the games. You can find a map of the keyboard controls in the multigame/KeyHandler class (in the arcade machine, we hooked these up to joysticks, but on a regular keyboard the controls are a bit less intuitive).
